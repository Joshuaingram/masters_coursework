It’s a bright corner studio with plenty of natural light but everything is in original condition and could be updated. The set up for the internet is located in the next door unit and you need to deal with the next door guests and cable company yourself if anything goes wrong. It shouldn’t be set up this way and the owner should deal with the problem when it occurs. Other than the above the owner was very responsive and tried to be helpful.'}]}"

The large underground parking is well lit, clean and roomy making manouvering our car very easy. It has direct elevator access to the apartment above, so unloading and loading the car was very convenient.\\n\\nThe area around the apartment has stores, restaurants, a Mercadona Supermarket, and many smaller grocery stores. The sidewalks are broad and evenly graded which makes for easy walking, and clean.\\n\\nPublic buses are frequent and easy to use, and there is an underground Metro station nearby within easy walking distance.\\n\\nDavid was what I would call a super host. His apartment was well equipped with every modern convenience and very clean. It was also very well stocked with food; bread, milk, juice, fresh fruit, butter, coking oil, etc., including a bottle of wine.\\n\\nHe patiently and carefully explained the works of every appliance in the apartment, including the use of the television features, and he made sure you are aware that he is available for any question later on. Communicating in English was not a problem.\\n\\nWe greatly appreciated the considerable time he spent providing us with detailed explanation of all the major attractions of Barcelona and how to get there. His Guest Guidebook includes all the details one could possibly ever need while in Barcelona, from managing emergency situations, using public transport, maps, to restaurants, shops, museums and all major attractions. Our visit to Barcelona was made much easier because of the book, and we learned a lot more.\\n\\nWe would recommend anyone visiting Barcelona to use David's place. We will definitely return to David's apartment if we should want to visit Barcelona again. The five days we were there were not enough.\\n\"},\n",

That\\'s reason enough to chose to stay at Centric Boutique at the Beach.  What comes as a bonus is David, a host who takes pride in what he does and who understands that \"goodwill is everything\".  It is no surprise that the owner has been awarded the Tripadvisor Certificate of Excellence.  \\n\\nDavid keeps in touch, checking in to see if/what there is anything we need, in addition to recommending places to visit.  It\\'s not just lip service.  For example, we suggested he consider adding a mat in the bathtub, which could be a bit slippery.  Later that day, DONE.\\n\\nFor example, when it was was time to vacate after our ten-day stay, we asked if would do us the favour of arranging for a mini-van to pick us up at 5:30am, as we were taking a train on to San Sebastian, and couldn\\'t risk any misunderstanding if we tried booking this ourselves.  After checking around, David came back with an answer.  The going rate was too high and he was still looking to find us much more reasonable transportation.  He DID.\\n\\nThis beautifully decorated, two-bedroom apartment is everything as described, well-equipped, well-stocked, clean and comfortable with a lovely balcony and close to all amenities.  \\n\\nDo we recommend it, most definitely YES.'},\n",

From the moment I booked, David made sure to stay in contact with us to ensure that we would be fully prepared for our Barcelona experience.  He even offered to pick us up at the airport!  Upon arrival, David gave us a car tour of the city and took us to some out of the way sights that we would have otherwise missed.  The day before we were leaving, I received a message from David offering to drop us back at the  airport.   He went above and beyond to make sure that our time in Barcelona was as wonderful as possible.  David is the ultimate host and I can't recommend him highly enough.\"},\n",

How to get to any museum or tourist attraction, where to go in Barcelona,  what to do with kids, where to go to a whole day journey outside the town etc. He's knowledge about Catalonia's history and Catalan architecture is unbelievable. We spending a whole week in Barcelona with our little daughter. She was so happy possessing her own room so she would not go outside. She told us every day she find herself as a princess. She's eight and believe me, she will never said this in our flat. The apartment is amazing. Full of every conveniences you need. Honestly, we haven't got in our own kitchen so many stuff. The apartment is stylish and cosy. So you could feel very comfortable here during your stay. If you need coffee you could make it in many ways, you could cooked here, prepared a dishes, and what it's really really awesome, you could spend a whole evening or night on a lovely terrace. But who wants to stayed on a terrace in Barcelona? If you decided to explore a town, you will find in David's apartment a special guide book which he prepared for his guests. You can't miss it. It's huge as an Encyclopedia Britannica. Neighbours are friendly, you will find a nice bakery and full equipped stores just around the corner. Location is just excellent. Lovely beach is a few blocks from your apartment, underground station just five minutes by walk. Bus stop is on the same corner as a David's apartment. It's hard to believe, but yes. You will find there everything what every high-maintenance resident need. So, if you really want to enjoy your stay at Barcelona, choose this unusual opportunity for living. You will not regret. We are sure! We fell in love with Barcelona, we fell in love with David and we plan to go back as soon as we can. What about next week?\"},\n",

His apartment is located in a quiet neighborhood, and was the perfect place to unwind after long days of exploring the city. It's super close to both the Metro line and Bus stops, and the beach is a short walk away. David's knowledge of Barcelona's history is incredible; he was able to help us plan out our stay, and make the most out of our experience. The value that he provides simply by being knowledgeable of the city and its best attractions is almost worth the price of staying at his apartment. No matter why you're visiting Barcelona, David will be able to make sure you have the best experience possible. I would HIGHLY recommend his apartment to anyone visiting the city for the first time, or anyone visiting Barcelona again.\"},\n",

Even though it's cold in November, we went over to the beach almost every day. The sunrises were stunning!  It was very nice to be in a quiet neighborhood and felt great to be out of the touristy areas. There is a grocery store just a few blocks away and a delicious bakery on the next block. Fresh croissants are the best! \\n\\nDavid was very helpful and showed the apartment and also offered to tell us all about seeing the city. He communicated through the Airnbn app during the week to make sure all was okay. The best thing was the refrigerator was stocked with water, milk, orange juice, water and even butter and jam. There was coffee and some muffins and toasts for the morning. What a nice touch to see a bowl of fresh fruit on the kitchen table. After a long day of travel, it was very nice to not have to worry about those things needed for the morning. \\n\\nThe apartment is in a very quiet area with a balcony and windows that look out onto a park. We couldn't hear any cars or traffic at all.\\n\\nI will definitely recommend the apartment to others. Even though it's a distance from the main part of the city, the Metro is SO easy to use and we could easily get to all of our destinations. We became Metro experts. What a fantastic transit system. If I return to Barcelona, I would definitely stay here again.\"},\n",

He went above and beyond any expectation I had of an Airbnb host, spending so much time welcoming my husband and I to his home, helping us create a custom itinerary for what to see while we were in Spain, and swooping in to help us when a travel plan outside of the city  fell through. Just an absolutely pleasure getting to know him and staying at his place.\\n\\nThe apartment itself is beautifully decorated and well set up, everything you could need is available. It’s in a quieter neighborhood of the city, which was perfect for us traveling with a small child, but only 3 blocks from the yellow line metro station so we were able to get almost anywhere in the city within 15 minutes. I would highly recommend staying there.'},\n",

We were in Barcelona for our honeymoon and we were thrilled that we had such a fantastic experience. The apartment is gorgeous, immaculate and very conveniently located with the beach just down the street and a quick train ride to anywhere you may want to go. We really enjoyed the neighborhood as well! He exceeded every expectation we had and if you're looking to stay in Barcelona, THIS must be your home while you're there. We couldn't recommend it more.

David contacted us professionally before our stay so we knew he would be good, but he certainly hit it out of the park with his incredible information about the area, perfectly clean apartment, all the thoughtful extras and the taking care of any question or problem we had (none with the apartment, but we almost missed our flight and he was a great help). David is the most thoughtful, gracious host.\\nHe provided us with all the information we needed and showed us around. The apartment is just perfect! Kitchen is roomy, and it contains everything one needs.\\nThe beds are comfortable, bathroom and terrace overlooking a nice courtyard with olive trees, are excellent. Location is incredible right near all the transportation lines (we never needed to cab it other than our manic ride to the airport when I mixed up our departure time by several hours, metro and bus is right there to all of Barcelona).\\nDavid had excellent restaurant, sightseeing and transportation recommendations and was of great help.  He shares everything he knows abour Barcelona, and it is comprehensive. He went way beyond anything I would call usual (though it seems to be for him) to make our long-weekend comfortable and memorable. I consider him a friend now!\\nQuiet neighborhood. Seems to be a lot of families here and it is very safe. You can walk here at any time, day or night. There is a cooking school right across the street and it was a great deal. 2 blocks over we attended an arts festival, the beach is 2 blocks the other way. On Sunday, we actually walked from La Rambla, to the seaport, down the beach and then to the apartment, seeing sights, people, entertainers and every type of food, beer and wine. What a great place.\\nWe could go on and on, but to summarize, this is a great, roomy apartment, fullequipped, central to all transportation, right near the beach, restaurants and things to do right nearby, David is fantastic (best host ever!). We hope to go back soon.'},\n",
